## Keener's Method

-> Assumption 1:
One's strength should be measured in relation to the other teams'
Where s_ii = 0 because you can't play against yourself

-> Assumption 2:
Ratings are a unit quanity distributed among tournament participants
Such that your rating improves as a teams' rating worsens as in a 
pie chart

-> Assumption 3:
s = 𝜆r
Where 𝜆 is a scaling factor of strength and rating

# Keener's formula
--> Sij = (sij + 1) / (sij + sji + 2)

# Skew to adjust for extreme values
--> h(x) = (1/2) + (1/2) * sign(x-1/2) * sqrt(|2x-1|)

Certainly! Let's compare Keener's method to Massey's method, highlighting their similarities, differences, and relative strengths.

Comparison of Keener's and Massey's Methods:

1. Basic Principle:

   Keener's Method:
   - Based on eigenvector centrality
   - Considers both wins and scoring margins
   - Accounts for strength of schedule implicitly

   Massey's Method:
   - Based on solving a system of linear equations
   - Primarily considers score differences
   - Explicitly accounts for strength of schedule

2. Input Data:

   Keener's Method:
   - Uses actual scores of games
   - Can incorporate additional performance metrics

   Massey's Method:
   - Primarily uses score differences
   - Typically doesn't incorporate additional metrics

3. Mathematical Approach:

   Keener's Method:
   - Constructs a matrix of pairwise comparisons
   - Finds the principal eigenvector of this matrix

   Massey's Method:
   - Constructs a matrix based on game outcomes
   - Solves Mr = p, where M is the Massey matrix, r is the rating vector, and p is the point differential vector

4. Iterative vs. Direct Solution:

   Keener's Method:
   - Typically solved iteratively (power method for eigenvector)

   Massey's Method:
   - Solved directly through matrix inversion or other linear algebra techniques

5. Handling of Unplayed Games:

   Keener's Method:
   - Introduces a dummy team to handle uneven schedules

   Massey's Method:
   - Naturally handles uneven schedules in its formulation

6. Sensitivity to Extreme Scores:

   Keener's Method:
   - Uses a skew function to mitigate the impact of extreme scores

   Massey's Method:
   - More sensitive to large score differences

7. Interpretability:

   Keener's Method:
   - Rankings represent a form of "importance" or "centrality" in the network of games

   Massey's Method:
   - Rankings directly represent expected point differentials

Example Comparison:

Let's use a simple example to illustrate the differences. Consider three teams A, B, and C with these game results:

A vs B: A wins 3-1
B vs C: C wins 2-0
C vs A: A wins 2-1

Keener's Method (simplified):

1. Construct the matrix:
   ```
      A       B       C
   A  0.5     0.75    0.6
   B  0.25    0.5     0.167
   C  0.4     0.833   0.5
   ```

2. Find the principal eigenvector (after iterations):
   ```
   A: 0.42
   B: 0.25
   C: 0.33
   ```

Massey's Method:

1. Construct the Massey matrix and point differential vector:
   ```
   M = [ 2 -1 -1]    p = [ 3]
       [-1  2 -1]        [-4]
       [-1 -1  2]        [ 1]
   ```

2. Solve Mr = p:
   ```
   A:  2.33
   B: -1.67
   C: -0.67
   ```

Visualization of Results:

```
Keener's Method     Massey's Method
0.5 |   A            3 |   A
    |   |  C           |   
0.3 |   |  |           |   
    |   |  |  B        |   
0.1 |   |  |  |     0  +---+---+---
    |   |  |  |        |       C
    +---+--+--+       -2 |   B   
```

Key Observations:
1. Both methods rank A first, but Keener's method shows C and B closer together.
2. Massey's method emphasizes the point differentials more, resulting in larger gaps between teams.
3. Keener's method provides normalized scores between 0 and 1, while Massey's ratings can be positive or negative.
