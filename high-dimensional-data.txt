Challenges of working with high dimensional data
- Beyond 3 dimensions it gets harder to vissualize without using some animation or other techniques
- We become stuck on which dimensions are important to make decisions with, becuase of the false sense of closeness 
- Its harder to know which dimensions affect the other (sensitivity or casual analysis)
- Its just harder to understand

> In high dimension, all points tend to be at the same distance from each other
> Which means that there can be risk of making bad assumptions on this observation
- DSTA Notes

> In higher dimension algorithms like clustering become useless, and distance based algorithms such as similarity
measures e.g. similarity also, due to points becoming orthogonal to the axes

// From Claude
False Sense of Parity (or "Curse of Dimensionality"):
In high-dimensional spaces, the concept of "closeness" or similarity becomes less meaningful. 
As the number of dimensions increases, the distance between any two points tends to become more uniform. This can create a false 
sense that all points are equidistant or similarly related, when in fact meaningful differences exist.

Sparsity: 
As dimensions increase, the available data becomes sparse in relation to the space it occupies, making it harder to find statistically significant patterns.

Computational Complexity: 
Algorithms often become exponentially more complex and time-consuming as dimensions increase.

Overfitting: 
With more dimensions, models are more prone to fitting noise in the training data, leading to poor generalization.

Difficulty in Visualization: 
Human intuition struggles with visualizing beyond three dimensions, making data interpretation challenging.

Feature Correlation: 
In high dimensions, features are more likely to be correlated, which can lead to redundancy and model instability.
Increased Risk of Spurious Correlations: With many dimensions, the chance of finding falsely significant relationships increases.
