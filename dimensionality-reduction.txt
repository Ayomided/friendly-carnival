# Rank of a matrix
Number of linearly independent columns of a matrix

> By doing Dimensionality reduction we incur some errors in the points as they dont exactly
lie on the line

Why dimentionality reduction?
-> Discove hidden correlations; latent dimenions hidden in the dataset
-> Reduce redundant or noisy features
-> interpretation and visualization
-> Easier storage and processing of data

Normally, abilities are
-> latent
-> hard to measure
-> time-dependent
-> place-dependent

yet, abilities are also
-> hard to transcend (revert-to-the-mean effect, RTTM)
-> relatively easy to perceive and project

Certainly. This set of definitions describes a framework for ranking players over time, potentially in multiple dimensions. Let's break it down:

1. Basic Definitions:
   - P: Set of players
   - |P| = n: There are n players
   - T: Set of time instants
   - r: P × T → ℝ: A function that assigns a real number rating to each player at each time instant

2. Ranking Function (ρ):
   - ρ: P × T → [1..n]: Assigns a rank (between 1 and n) to each player at each time
   - ρ(p,t) = k ↔ |{pj : r(pj,t) ≤ r(pi,t)}| = k
     This means: A player p at time t has rank k if and only if there are k players (including p) whose rating is less than or equal to p's rating at time t.

3. Distance Function (δ):
   - δ(pi,pj,t) = |r(pi,t) − r(pj,t)|
   - This measures the absolute difference in ratings between two players at a given time
   - It captures both similarity (small δ) and distance (large δ) between players' ratings

4. Multi-dimensional Ranking:
   - rmulti: P × T → ℝd: Assigns a d-dimensional real vector of ratings to each player at each time
   - Often, rmulti(pi,t) = f(r1(pi,t), ..., rd(pi,t))
     This means the multi-dimensional rating is often a function of individual ratings in each dimension

5. Pareto Dominance:
   - In multi-dimensional rankings, pi dominates pj at time t if:
     For every dimension x, rx(pi,t) ≥ rx(pj,t)
   - This means pi is at least as good as pj in all dimensions, and better in at least one

Applications and Implications:

1. Player Rankings: 
   This system can be used to rank players in games, sports, or any competitive scenario over time.

2. Dynamic Rankings: 
   The inclusion of time (T) allows for tracking how rankings change over time.

3. Multi-faceted Evaluation: 
   The multi-dimensional aspect allows for ranking based on multiple criteria simultaneously.

4. Comparative Analysis: 
   The δ function allows for quantifying how close or far apart players are in their ratings.

5. Non-linear Rankings: 
   The Pareto dominance concept allows for situations where there's no clear linear ordering of players.

6. Flexible Aggregation: 
   The function f in the multi-dimensional case allows for different ways of combining dimensional ratings.

7. Complex Decision Making: 
   This framework can be used in scenarios where decisions need to be made based on multiple, possibly conflicting criteria over time.

This framework is particularly useful in data science for:
- Analyzing player performance in esports or traditional sports
- Ranking products or services based on multiple features
- Evaluating employee performance across various metrics
- Assessing the evolution of entities (companies, countries, etc.) across multiple dimensions over time

Should we keep user ratings?
Yes 
-> Feeling of improvement 
-> Gauge for new features  
-> Better matchmaking 

No
-> Not necessary for casual viewers
